## _Synther_: Project Proposal

My final project will be an app called _Synther_ that uses Cinder to build a virtual piano keyboard, which can be used to play, record, and playback simple musical pieces. The app will map a standard QWERTY keyboard to a virtual piano keyboard, allowing the user to "play" a piano on their computer. At a minimum, _Synther_ will offer a user the ability to play a composition, record the composition to a file, and eventually load in a recorded file to watch the piano automatically play the composition.

As a pianist, I have a fair amount of background knowledge on music. In fact, I have a handful of apps currently installed on my phone that offer virtual keybaord capabitilies (like _GarageBand_ and _PianoCompanion_), just in case I want to visualize a tune that's stuck in my head. I think it would be interesting to build a similar app that not only _plays_ simple notes, but also offers recording and playback capabilities. I'm also interested in exploring the countless avenues for extension on a simple _Synther_ implementation, like adding the ability to connect to an external synthesizer, loading in MIDI files, and supporting different sounds/instruments. Overall, I think this project would be a great way to implement my own version of a product that I use almost daily: virtual music.

This project can be split into 3 main steps: Building the underlying piano engine, implementing the GUI in Cinder, implementing the special features like loading and playing back compositions. By the end of week 1, I will have build the majority of the piano engine, including all the data structures and classes necessary to represent a virtual keyboard, music notes/rhythm, and musical compositions. Then, during week 2, I will work on connecting the piano engine to a Cinder-based GUI. This will include visualizing the piano and taking user inputs (which will require determining how to store all key-mappings from a QWERTY keyboard to a piano keyboard). Finally, during week 3, I will implement the special features of the project. I will have learn how to handle audio in Cinder and connect my audio engine to the piano engine. During week 3, I will also implement saving and loading music, which I will have to connect to the Cinder GUI and my audio engine.

Some components of the timeline above will likely have to be readjusted. For example, I might be able to build both the GUI and audio engine during week 2, which will allow me to spend more time on implementing my special features (loading and saving). I will also likely be able to implement the loading/saving logic during week 2, as a implement my classes. This will give me even more time during week 3, which I could use to begin working on some "stretch goals."
