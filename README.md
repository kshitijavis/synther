# Description
Welcome to _Synther_, an interactive, intuitive, virtual keyboard. Offering support for over 15 instruments, _Synther_ emulates a synthesizer and brings music production and experimentation to your computer! The goal of _Synther_ is provide a musical experience that looks and feels like a real piano, through C++ and the Cinder library.

# Installation
This project is currently stable for MacOS. 
This project requires the Cinder framework. First, we need to set up Cinder. These instructions are modified from [UIUC Fall 2020 NaiveBayes](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs126/fa2020/assignments/naive-bayes/)
* Download [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/download) (v0.9.2)
* Extract the downloaded into a folder. We will call this folder `~/Cinder`
* Follow the Instructions(https://www.libcinder.org/docs/guides/cmake/cmake.html#building-libcinder-with-cmake) for building LibCinder with CMake
* * Alternatively, if using the CLion IDE, navigate to ~/Cinder and select `Run` -> `Build`
* Create a directory caled `my-projects` in `~/Cinder`. Navigate to `my-projects` and clone this repository inside.
